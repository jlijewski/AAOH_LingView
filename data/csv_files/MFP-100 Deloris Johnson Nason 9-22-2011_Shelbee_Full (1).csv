N:     I’m forty-three years old and I love      Greenwood; and I love McLaurin Street.,,,,,,,
N:     I love McLaurin Street; because      this is a historical place that I teaches my children; on Children’s      Day; about McLaurin’s Park; that it was a historical park cause it      was the first black school for the for the black children.,,1,,,,,
W:     What is it that’s so exciting and historical about McLaurin Park;      McLaurin Street; and Greenwood that you love so much?,,,,,,,
N:     I just really love the people; because I’m a people person myself;      and I just love the people and I love the children; and I love the      idea that I know that I can teach the other children that McLaurin is      not just only a park; it is an historical park where there was once      McNiece School.,,,,,,,
W:     Did; what do you know about that McNiece School?,,,,,,,

N:     Yes; she was.,,,,,,,
N:     Miss My mother; Missus Baby Ruth Johnson; she was a community      leader with all the kids:,,,,,,,
N:     with all the people.,,,,,,,
N:     She was a people      person.,,,,,,,
N:     She loved to talk.,,,,,,,
N:     And she always loved to ask; how you doing;      and you have a nice day.,,,,,,,

W:     Mm-hm.,,,,,,,
W:     Well; you very you definitely are.,,,,,,,
W:     You let me come over and interview.,,,,,,,
W:          What do you think the qualities of a leader—what makes a person a      leadership—a leader?,,,,,,,
N:     I believe what makes a person a leader is the communication and the      understanding from the people out in the community.,,,,,,,
N:     You have to get      out here to know the people; to know the children:,,,,,,,
N:     to see the children      and to see the people; and the elderly people; is what I love.,,,,,,,
N:     I love the      elderly people.,,,,,,,
N:     I have a neighbor.,,,,,,,

N:     Yes.,,,,,,,
W:     As long as you know.,,,,,,,
N:     As long as I know; yes; sir.,,,,,,,
W:     You know; people talk about the civil rights movement and they talk      about Doc Doctor Martin Luther King and Medgar Evers in Mississippi.,,,,,,,
W:     By      living here in this community and having been here with your forty-      three years; what what are your reflections?,,,,,,,
W:     What does the civil rights      movement mean to you?,,,,,,,
N:     The civil rights movement means to me that...,,,,,,,
N:     I mean; we have a      great deal to learn about it; you know; but I know it was gave a lot of us      the rights to do a lot of things that we couldn’t do.,,,,,,,
N:     You know?,,,,,,,
N:     It      just—a lot of things; the civil rights just gave us a lot of things      that we couldn’t do.,1,,,1,,,
N:     I love to see all people together; you know.,,,,,,,
W:     Do you think that the civil rights movement is continuing today?,,,,,,,
W:     Or      some people say that people have lost their way and we’re losing our      rights because of the way the government works—we have a president      who's under pressure.,,,,,,,
W:     Do you think the civil rights movement is      continuing?,,,,,,,
W:     It’s still positive?,,,,,,,
W:     Or is there more work to be done?,,,,,,,
N:     Yeah; I believe it needs to be more work done; but I believe our      president is only doing what he could do.,,,,1,,,
N:     You know?,,,,,,,
N:     I believe he’s      doing a good job.,,,,,,,
N:     I really do; I believe he’s doing a good job.,,,,,,,
N:     It’s      just us as people:,,,,,,,
N:     we have to get together and stick together and learn      to love one another.,,,,,,,
N:     We must learn to love one another; all of us.,,,,,,,
N:     And      I do; I love everybody.,,,,,,,
W:     Do you think that he can be re-elected again?,,,,,,,
N:     Oh; yes.,,,,,,,
N:     Oh; yes.,,,,,,,
N:     Yes; yes; yes I do.,,,,,,,
N:     I believe Barack Obama can be      elected again.,,,,,,,
N:     Yes; I do.,,,,,,,
W:     What kind of activities are they do you think are going to take place in this      neighborhood to help get him elected again?,,,,,,,
N:     Well; we—just to be honest with you; I believe too many people is      really scared to come here over on McLaurin Street; but if you come      over here on McLaurin Street; you don’t feel nothing but joy and love      once you really get over here to really to see it and not to go by      what people say about McLaurin Street; because all of us love each      other out here.,,1,1,,,,
N:     We’re all just one big family over here on McLaurin      Street.,,,,,,,
W:     Well; see; for me; I’m from Florida; so I don’t know what people say      about McLaurin or why it wouldn’t be safe.,,,,,,,
N:     McLaurin is so dangerous; there’s crime; drugs; but that’s not true.,,,,1*,,,
N:          It's crime everywhere.,,,,1*,,,
N:     But they consider McLaurin Street; it’s so      dangerous.,,,,,,,
N:     But it’s not like that because; everybody here around      McLaurin; we love one another around here and it’s not bad.,,,,,,,
N:     We get      together and we go and pick up paper out of our park; because we love      our park.,,,,,,,
N:     We go around in the community and get paper up so; when the      city workers come out here; they don’t have to do too much; because      we’re going to do it.,,,,,,,
N:     Because people are actually scared to come      around McLaurin Street; and I hate that.,,,,,,,
N:     And I hate the city      government that they only come when it’s time for to be elected;      and only if they just come out here to get a chance to see the people;      to see the people—because we vote; too.,,,,,,,
N:     We want somebody to come out      and help us.,,,,,,,
N:     So; when the people came out here and gave us our gazebo      in the park; I actually cried; because I was happy to see this:,,,,,,,
N:     to      know this is a historical park.,,,,,,,
N:     and I was just overwhelmed to know      that they finally did it.,,,,,,,
N:     You know?,,,,,,,
N:     I was jumping for joy; because I      love this park.,,,,,,,
N:     I love McLaurin.,,,,,,,
W:     What can be done to help more people understand that McLaurin Park      and McLaurin Street is a great place and it belongs to all the people      of Greenwood?,,,,,,,
N:     Well; actually that they need to come out here and see the people and      see what we do out here; not judge us because things they probably      read—and it’s not the people that actually stay on McLaurin that are      causing the problem; it’s other people that come from other places      that they consider that it’s a good spot.,,,,,,,
N:     and that McLaurin is so bad; so they      consider us all us bad; but we’re not.,,,,,,,
N:     Because I been here forty-three      years; like I said; and I love McLaurin.,,,,,,,
W:     Over the next...,,,,,,,
W:     say; week; what kind of things are you going to      be doing to help make your community a better place?,,,,,,,
N:     What I do; I always get my kids.,,,,,,,
N:     Anything that they need; dealing      with the school; homework:,,,,,,,
N:     when they get off the bus; I ask them what      kind of homework they have.,,,,,,,
N:     I only have one computer; but I bet you;      it be nine or ten children on that one computer.,,,,,,,
N:     I tried to get      another; just to help them; because a lot of children don’t have      computers and every kid needs a computer.,,,,,,,
N:     I try to open up my house      for the kids in the neighborhood; because what I got; I didn’t get it      by myself:,,,,,,,
N:     God gave it to me.,,,,,,,
N:     So I just open up my heart and my house      and my love for the kids in the neighborhood.,,,,,,,
W:     Do you have your own children?,,,,,,,
N:     I have a son; nineteen years old; just one.,,,,,,,
W:     Okay; what is his name?,,,,,,,
N:     His name is Denarius.,,,,,,,
W:     Okay; and when was he born?,,,,,,,
N:     He was born in 1990.,,,,,,,
N:     After my husband; he served in the Gulf War for      seven years.,,,,,,,
N:     My husband was injured in the Gulf War—his name is Willie      Nason—he was injured.,,,,,,,
N:     And I said; if my husband get back to the United      States; I’m going to have my husband a baby; and that’s what I did.,,1,,,,,
W:     So; your husband—is the government taking adequate care of him?,,,,,,,
W:     Does      he receive his benefits?,,,,,,,
N:     No.,,,,,,,
N:     It was It is just hard for him to even...,,,,,,,
N:     he have a little restaurant.,,,,,,,
N:          He have a little restaurant.,,,,,,,
N:     Like; I have a snowball stand on this      end:,,,,,,,
N:     he have a little restaurant on the corner of Brewer Lane and Rawl      Street.,,,,,,,
N:     It’s it's called the Gizzard Stop.,,,,,,,
N:     So; he did that to try to make      ends meet.,,,,,,,
N:     But the problem that we have is the harassment with the      Greenwood Police Department; and that’s just honestly the truth.,,,,,,,
W:     What kind of harassment do you receive from the police?,,,,,,,
N:     We have harassment with the Greenwood Police Department where; as      that—when they come through the neighborhood; like I say; I sell     snowballs.,,,,,,,
N:     and this yard here is big enough for all my kids to be here.,,,,,,,
N:          They can come and pull up on the corner and say; you need to get back      on the porch.,,,,,,,
N:     So I’m like; why?,,,,,,,
N:     and this is my yard.,,,,,,,
N:     This here is for the      kids.,,,,,,,
N:     You know so; you can have wanna have events at the park; now you have to      get a permit.,,,,,,,
N:     I didn’t have Children’s Day this past year in the      McLaurin Park because you have to get a permit.,,,,,,,
N:     Sometimes; it’s hard      to get a permit because they want charge you.,,,,,,,
N:     This is something for      the kids to have; and I just don’t feel like it’s fair; so I just get      my yard and my people that love the kids—this lady here; Missus Vicky;      precious—and we just do what we could for the kids.,,,,,,,
N:     But the harassment      from the Greenwood Police Department; I feel that our mayor and our      city councilmans; they need to come out here and show they face and be      able to understand and communicate with us.,,,,,,,
N:     Everybody around here      don’t sell drugs.,,,,,,,
N:     Everybody around here don’t do drugs.,,,,,,,
N:          Everybody—anything that I need from the people in the community for      these kids; they give it to me.,,,,,,,
N:     Halloween; we have a Halloween party      right here in my yard; because certain things we can’t do in McLaurin      Park.,,,,,,,
N:     They turn the lights out on us at ten o’clock at the park.,,,,,,,
N:     We can      have events at the park; but it’s just certain things that we can and      certain things we can’t do.,,,,1,,,
W:     Have you talked to the mayor or tried to have negotiations with the      police about this treatment?,,,,,,,
N:     Well well; in order to talk to our mayor; Miss Caroline McAdams; she says;      the door is always open.,,,,,,,
N:     But you do have to call for an appointment.,,,,,,,
N:          Her secretary always say; she’s not in.,,,,,,,
N:     But I do have one police      officer; I can say.,,,,,,,
N:     His name is Willie Hearns.,,,,,,,
N:     Like I told the      detective the other day; that we had a young man that came through our      neighborhood shooting.,,,,,,,
N:     The only thing that I told him:,,,,,,,
N:     that the police      officers should just come out.,,,,,,,
N:     We have one police officer that I know      that come in our bad neighborhood; which is McLaurin Street.,,,,,,,
N:     His name      is Willie Hearns.,,,,,,,
N:     He actually come out here and participate his self      with our children; to let our children know that he’s here to protect      them; not to be afraid of them.,,1,,,,,
N:     Because Katie love—the tree that's the tree named      after her—she used to be scared of the police.,,,,,,,
N:     Every time she would      see the police; she’d run.,,,,,,,
N:     Every time the kids see the police; they      run.,,,,,,,
N:     But I had him to come out here to let the kids; let the kids      know; it’s not like that.,,,,,,,
W:     I’m glad that you pointed that out; the name of the tree.,,,,,,,
W:     Why why does      the tree have a name?,,,,,,,
W:     What is the significance of that?,,,,,,,
N:     Because of my great-niece.,,,,,,,
N:     Her name is Kaitlyn Jashia Harris.,,,,,,,
N:          Everytime somebody come up; she want to show ‘em love.,,,,,,,
N:     This is her      signal—Katie’s love.,,,,,,,
W:     Okay.,,,,,,,
W:     So; we’re bumping fists.,,,,,,,
N:     Yeah.,,,,,,,
N:     Katie Love.,,,,,,,
N:     Show me some love; Katie love.,,,,,,,
N:     That’s it.,,,,,,,
N:     I wish      she was out here.,,,,,,,
N:     She’s with uh her mother.,,,,,,,
W:     You talk about Children’s Day.,,,,,,,
W:     Is that something that you have helped      to get together locally; or was that going before—?,,,,,,,
N:     That’s just something that I just do because I know; in the month of      June; after Father’s Day; it’s always Children’s Day.,,,,,,,
N:     I try to make it      my business to do something for the children for Children’s Day.,,,,,,,
N:     For    for uh  Easter; get them a nice little Easter egg hunt.,,,,,,,
N:     You know; for      Halloween; to make sure they have candy.,,,,,,,
N:     Just to do a lot of little      things.,,,,,,,
N:     But the last year I had Easter—had Halloween; giving out      candy; and I was sitting on my front porch.,,,,,,,
N:     And you know the people      come and park in front.,,,,,,,
N:     The police officer tell the people to move in      front of the house.,,,,,,,
N:     I’m like; it’s Halloween.,,,,,,,
N:     They’re just only      letting the kids out to get some candy.,,,,,,,
N:     And this lady had to make the      whole block around; and I don’t believe that—that little bit there?,,,,,,,
N:          The one  that caused them enough for—they know it’s Halloween.,,,,,,,
N:     They      let the kids get out there and just get a little candy; that’s all.,,,,,,,
W:     How long have you been participating in the Children’s Day activity?,,,,,,,
N:     I have been participating for seven years.,,,,,,,
W:     Okay.,,,,,,,
W:     And is it something that gets a good turnout in the community?,,,,,,,

N:     I invite all the children; let all the children know.,,,,,,,
N:     All the      children to come on out for Children’s Day; and we have a good time.,,,,,,,
N:          Volleyball; kickball; baseball.,,,,,,,
N:     Everything that we can have; we do it      for the kids.,,,,,,,
W:     So you believe investing in children is very important.,,,,,,,
N:     Oh; yes.,,,,,,,
N:     Yes.,,,,,,,
N:     Got to say the kids—all the kids; because some kids      don’t have.,,,,,,,
N:     And I don’t care about what no kid mother have; or if      they getting food stamps.,,,,,,,
